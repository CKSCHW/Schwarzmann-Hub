# Fixing a Broken Nginx Installation on Ubuntu

The server logs indicate that the `nginx` package installation failed. This is usually due to a corrupted state in the `apt` package manager, which prevented the main configuration file from being created.

## Steps to Fix

Run the following commands in your Ubuntu server's terminal. This will completely remove the broken packages and perform a clean reinstallation.

### 1. Purge Existing Nginx Packages
This command removes Nginx and all of its associated configuration files, which is necessary to resolve the issue.

```bash
sudo apt-get purge nginx nginx-common -y
```

### 2. Remove Unused Dependencies
This cleans up any packages that were installed for Nginx but are no longer needed.

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove -y
```

### 3. Update Package Lists
This ensures you are installing the latest version from the repositories.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### 4. Install Nginx Again
This will perform a fresh, clean installation of Nginx.
```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```

After running these commands, Nginx should be installed correctly. You can verify its status with `systemctl status nginx`. Once it's running, you can continue with the deployment guide I provided earlier, starting from the step **"Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy"**.
