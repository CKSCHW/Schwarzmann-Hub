# Fixing a Stubborn Nginx Installation on Ubuntu

I'm sorry to hear the previous steps didn't work. That's very frustrating! The logs show the exact same core issue: the `apt` package manager is failing to install Nginx because a critical configuration file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) is not being created. This puts the package manager in a broken state.

This sometimes happens when a previous installation leaves behind conflicting files or configurations that the standard `purge` command doesn't remove.

Let's try a more aggressive approach to completely eradicate any trace of Nginx from your system before reinstalling. Please run these commands in your Ubuntu terminal in this exact order.

### 1. Stop and Kill Any Lingering Nginx Processes
This ensures nothing is locking the files.
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo killall -9 nginx || true
```

### 2. Aggressively Purge All Nginx-Related Packages
This targets `nginx` and anything that starts with `nginx`.
```bash
sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove nginx* -y
```

### 3. Manually Remove Leftover Directories
This is the most critical step to ensure a clean slate.
```bash
sudo rm -rf /etc/nginx/
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/nginx/
```

### 4. Clean and Update Apt
This clears the local package cache and fetches the latest lists from the repositories.
```bash
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get update
```

### 5. Install Nginx Again
With everything truly gone, this installation should now succeed.
```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
```

After these steps, Nginx should finally be installed correctly. You can verify its status with `systemctl status nginx`. Once it's running, you can proceed with the deployment guide, starting from the step **"Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy"**.
